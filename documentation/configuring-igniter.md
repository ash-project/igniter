# Configuring Igniter

This guide is for those who are _end-users_ of igniter, for example, using the generators provided by a library that are backed by igniter.

## Setting up igniter

Use `mix igniter.setup` to create a `.igniter.exs` file in your project root. This file configures igniter for your project. You can run this command repeatedly to keep the file up to date over time.

See the documentation in `Igniter.Project.IgniterConfig` for available configuration.

## Extensions

Igniter supports extensions. These extensions are limited to determining where modules should be created (i.e a module in `/web` ending in `Controller`).
This is not bulletproof and will likely need to be improved over time. (The best thing would be if Phoenix conventions were the same as the
elixir conventions of module names matching paths). To this end, you will want to add the phoenix extension if your generator builds any phoenix-related modules.

For an end user, this can be done with `mix igniter.add_extension phoenix`.

For those writing tasks, use `Igniter.compose_task("igniter.add_extension", ["phoenix"])`.

## Moving files

One available configuration is `module_location`. This configuration dictates where modules are placed when there is a folder that exactly matches their module name. There are two available strategies for this, and with igniter not only can you change your mind, but you can actually _move back and forth_ between each strategy. To move any modules to their rightful place, use `mix igniter.move_files`.

## `:outside_matching_folder`

The "standard" way to place a module is to place it in a folder path that exactly matches its module name, inside of `lib/`. For example, a module named `MyApp.MyModule` would be placed in `lib/my_app/my_module.ex`.

Use the default `:outside_matching_folder` to follow this convention in all cases.

## `:inside_matching_folder`

What some people don't like about the previously described strategy is that it can split up related modules. For example:

```
lib/
└── my_app/
    ├── accounts/
    │   ├── user.ex
    │   ├── organization.ex
    ├── social/
    │   ├── post.ex
    │   ├── comment.ex
    ├── accounts.ex # <- This feels to some like it should be in `/accounts`
    └── social.ex
```

They would prefer to put that leaf-node module in its matching folder _if it exists_, and otherwise follow the original convention if not.

```
lib/
└── my_app/
    ├── accounts/
    │   ├── user.ex
    │   ├── organization.ex
    │   ├── accounts.ex
    ├── social/
    │   ├── post.ex
    │   ├── comment.ex
    │   └── social.ex
```
